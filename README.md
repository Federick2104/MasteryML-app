# MasteryML

MasteryML is a machine learning mobile application that focuses on object detection and Deep Learning. It is designed to be a showcase for ML, teaching users about the basics of ML and its opportunities. The app includes a "Learn" section where users can learn about the topic and understand the basics of ML, including the practical example mentioned before (Object Detection). After the "Learn" phase, there will be the "Training" phase, which means testing oneself with interactive quizzes on the previously learned notions and general concepts. The app also includes a "Community" section where logged-in users can exchange opinions on the topic at hand and ask quiz questions related to the chosen topic.
